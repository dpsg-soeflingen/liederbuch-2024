    \begin{guitarMagic}

        [G]Almost Heaven, [Em]West Virginia, \\
        [D]Blue Ridge Mountains, Sh[C]enandoah R[G]iver. \\
        [G]Life is old there, [Em]older than the trees, \\
        y[D]ounger than the mountains, gr[C]owin' like a breeze.

        \begin{chorus}
            Country R[G]oads, take me h[D]ome, 
            to the p[Em]lace, I bel[C]ong, \\
            West Virg[G]inia, mountain m[D]ama, 
            take me h[C]ome, country r[G]oads.
        \end{chorus}

        [G]All my memories [Em]gather round her, \\
        [D]miner's lady, str[C]anger to blue w[G]ater. \\
        [G]Dark and dusty, [Em]painted on the sky, \\
        m[D]isty taste of moonshine, te[C]ardrop in my [G]eye. \\

        \textbf{Refrain}

        \begin{bridge}
            [Em]I hear her v[D]oice in the m[G]orning hour she calls me, \\
            The [C]radio rem[G]inds me of my [D]home far away. \\
            And [Em]driving down the r[F]oad I get a f[C]eeling \\
            That I [G]should have been home [D]yesterday, yesterd[D7]ay.
        \end{bridge}

        \textbf{Refrain (x2)}
